			   discription : "There's nothing better than doing something worthwhile, and making money to boot! Everyone you know older than five has been influenced by a teacher. Teachers prepare and educate students for the world. Starting with teaching the basics of math, reading and skills in preschool and elementary school, and move to more complex and specialized concepts in middle, high school and post-secondary school.Teachers create lesson plans and teach those plans to the entire class, individually to students or in small groups, track student progress and present the information to parents, create tests, create and reinforce classroom rules, work with school administration prepare students for standardized tests, and manage students outside the classroom, such as in school hallways, detention, etc.Other types of teachers include special education teachers, who work with students with a range of disabilities, adult literacy and GED teachers, working with adults and young adults who are no longer in school, and post-secondary teachers in colleges, universities and vocational schools.Depending on state laws, preschool teachers may only need a high school diploma and certification or a college degree.For elementary through high school teachers, you must have a bachelor's degree in education. Some states require teachers to have a degree in a specific area, such as english or history. In some instances, a master's degree is required. In addition, teachers must be licensed by the state, also known as state certification. Teachers in private schools may not need state certification.Special education teachers can also get a bachelor's degree in special education.Postsecondary teachers at universities and community colleges have at least a master's degree, and many have a Ph.D. in their field. For vocational schools, experience in the field is more important.",
